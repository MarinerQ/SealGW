# SEmi-Analitical Localization for Gravitational Waves (SealGW) 

A semi-analytical approach for sky localization of gravitational waves, tested on LHV network (see [Phys. Rev. D 104, 104008 (2021)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.104008) or [arXiv:2110.01874](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01874) for details). We are trying to employ it in [SPIIR pipeline](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/spiir/) in LVK's O4 detection run.

## Installation
